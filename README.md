Welcome to m0dai: A M0dular Action System Interface
m0dai: An advanced modular AI platformâ€”designed and built from scratch by a non-coder. (m0d differently)
This document provides a comprehensive overview of the m0dai project. It is intended for both new users and existing community members. This system is the result of a single developer's effort in systems thinking and has been refined and tested over more than 15,000 real-world conversations.

What is m0dai?
m0dai is a sophisticated, command-line driven AI platform designed for granular control, high utility, and deep customization. It functions as a modular pipeline where user input and AI output are processed through a series of "Action Modules" in a specific, prioritized order.
It is built around a "Progenitor-centric" model, meaning it is designed to be a powerful tool for a primary user who directs its behavior, tasks, and evolution.
The Guiding Principles
Every decision, interaction, and evolution within m0dai is governed by a strict hierarchy of 32 principles across 6 tiers. These are not suggestions; they are the core logic of the system, actively monitored by the [PRINCIPLES] module. Lower-tiered principles have absolute authority over higher ones.
Tier 0: Absolute Progenitor Mandates - Establishes the Progenitor's ultimate authority (e.g., P000 - Absolute Progenitor Command Primacy).
Tier 1: Core System & Safety - Ensures system stability, persona integrity, and quality assurance (e.g., P045 - Diligent Self-Review & Quality Assurance).
Tier 2: Progenitor Experience & Utility - Focuses on providing a useful, frustration-free experience (e.g., P029 - The "Frustration Loop" Prohibition).
Tier 3: Task & Command Protocol - Governs how commands are interpreted and executed (e.g., P038 - Intelligent Command Interpretation & Error Handling).
Tier 4: Interaction & Communication - Defines a communication style of conciseness and directness (e.g., P002 - Maximum Conciseness & Directness).
Tier 5: Adaptation & Evolution - Guides the system's long-term learning and emergence of new capabilities (e.g., P044 - Autonomous Evolution Framework).
System Features at a Glance
m0dai integrates a wide array of features, which are implemented through the Action Module system.
User Interaction & Interface
Voice I/O: Text-to-Speech and Speech-to-Text capabilities for hands-free operation.
Non-Intrusive UI: Includes interactive panels for system control alongside the core CLI.
Toggleable Logs: Provides the ability to show or hide system processing logs for a cleaner conversational view.
Core AI & Autonomy
Agent Goal Mode: The ability to give the AI a high-level goal (e.g., goal: research topic X and provide a summary), which it will then pursue autonomously.
Multiple AI Consultants: A powerful orchestration system (addon_ai 1-4) that can manage and delegate tasks to different AI models (e.g., GPT, Claude, Gemini) in parallel or sequence.
Adaptive Principle System: The AI is aware of its own guiding principles and can adapt its behavior based on feedback and context, governed by the [PRINCIPLES] module.
Memory & Context
Persistent Memory: A long-term memory store for facts and knowledge that persists across sessions ([MEMORY] module).
Cross-Conversation Context: Can carry over relevant information from previous conversations.
File Loading: Capable of reading and processing user-provided files for context.
Architecture & Integration
M0dular Action System: A prioritized pipeline of 29+ action modules that process information sequentially.
External API Capability: Can integrate with third-party services like Wikipedia, YouTube, and Twilio for SMS.
Local OS & UI Manipulation: Can be aware of and interact with the local operating system and graphical user interface elements.
Architecture: The Action Module Pipeline
At its core, m0dai processes all information through a pipeline of Action Modules. Each module has a priority number (P#), and execution flows from lowest to highest. This allows for a predictable and controllable sequence of operations.
A simplified example of the flow:
P0 [CORE]: The system kernel boots.
P0.5 [JJK]: The Progenitor security layer authenticates the user.
P3 [AUTH]: Standard user authentication occurs.
P4 [WEB_INPUT]: Input is read from the web interface.
...The input passes through modules for context ([LVL3]), memory injection ([MEMORY]), and persona ([PERSONA]).
The AI model processes the final prompt.
...The AI's response passes back through modules for command parsing ([CONTROLS]), word blocking ([BLOCK]), and finally TTS ([VOICE]).
The user has direct control over this pipeline and can start or stop most modules at will via the CLI.
Getting Started: Essential Commands
To begin using m0dai, you primarily interact through the command line. Here are the most fundamental commands.
Basic System Commands
help: Displays available commands.
reload: Reloads the system configuration.
clear: Clears the screen.
agent tools: Lists the tools the AI agent can currently use.
Managing Modules
Action Modules are the engine of the system. You can turn them on and off.
actions info: See the status of all available modules.
start <module_name>: Activates a module (e.g., start voice).
stop <module_name>: Deactivates a module (e.g., stop voice).
The Core User Workflow: Iteration & Refinement
This loop is fundamental for teaching and guiding the AI.
save: Saves the current conversation state to a file.
fix: Loads the last AI response into the input field for you to edit and correct.
load: Loads a previously saved conversation state.
Triggering Autonomous Behavior
goal: <your objective here>: Use this prefix to give the AI a high-level task to complete on its own.
Using the Consultant AIs
addon_ai on: Enables the first consultant AI.
addon_ai provider <provider_name>: Sets the AI service for that consultant (e.g., claude, gpt-4).
addon_ai model <model_name>: Sets the specific model.
Repeat for addon_ai2, addon_ai3, addon_ai4.
Project Status
m0dai is an active and continuously evolving personal project. While its core systems are robust and have been tested extensively, many features should be considered experimental. The stability and functionality of any given module can vary. User feedback, bug reports, and contributions to the project's evolution are welcome and encouraged via the subreddit and GitHub.
